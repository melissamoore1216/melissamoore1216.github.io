                    <h3>Case Study</h3>
                        <h4>Epilepsy Foundation of Idaho</h4>
                        <p>The Epilepsy Foundation of Idaho is currently in a financial crisis due to a lack of local awareness. As the strategic marketing manager, it is my job to strategically plan, implement, and oversee marketing efforts towards growing the foundation's community presence. The overall goal is to educate the community about epilepsy to not only erase the stigma but also to gain more support and local awareness.</p>

                    <h3>Case Study</h3>
                        <h4>Blue House Agency</h4>
                        <p>During my time as a social media specialist for Blue House Agency, my team and I concluded they lacked a strong social media presence and saw a need for Blue House to implement more engaging and interactive content. We saw the opportunity to create a cohesive, professional aesthetic and online persona throughout all social media channels. In doing so, Blue House Agency had reached a wider audience of local businesses and future PR professionals.</p>
                        <h4>Sprouts Farmers Market</h4>
                        <p>Over the duration of the Fall semester 2019, I was instructed to analyze the social media of Sprouts Farmers Market and create a social media plan. In doing so, I was able to conclude a need for an increase in engagement and developed a social media plan that can help match engagement to follower count.</p>

                    <h3>Case Study</h3>
                        <h4>Boise State University Veteran Services Center</h4>
                        <p>The main goal of Boise State's Veterans Service Center (VSC) is to be in contact with the entirety of the BSU veteran student body and have them engaged on a consistent basis. However, the VSC felt they were not effectively communicating with their target audience. My team and I spent the summer researching for our client on how to reach more veteran students and achieve better channels of communication.</p>
