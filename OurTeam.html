    <h3>MELISSA MOORE</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px"> I grew up in Bakersfield, CA but just fell in love with the city of Boise at first glance. I'm a Media Arts major with a PR emphasis and I'll be graduating this Fall which means a virtual ceremony (thanks COVID); but I'm just happy to celebrate my accomplishment! I've only lived here for four years but I plan on making this beautiful city my permanent home upon graduation. </p>

    <h3>KATIE FOSTER</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px">I am originally from Seattle, Washington. I have lived in the Boise area for six years and have made lastly relationships. Growing up in the city was a very different lifestyle than living here in Boise. Overall, itâ€™s just higher pace in Seattle. I am a communication major graduating this semester, so web development has never really been on my mind to learn about.</p>

        <hr>
        <p style="color:white;">Katie and I hadn't partnered up until Week 5 after our original partners dropped the course. Both of us had zero experience in web development so this course was definitely a struggle, to say the least. However, she and I managed to get through those rough patches with a lot of hard work and dedication. We'd like to thank Youtube for allowing us to binge-watch how-to videos and get clarification on just about everything. Click below to check out our weekly interviews!</p>
