                <hr>
                <p>My name is Melissa and I'm a Media Arts major with a PR emphasis. I'll be graduating this Fall! I grew up in Bakersfield, CA but just fell in love with Boise. Plus, it was pretty far and I honestly just wanted to get out of California. Anyone else? I currently work as a marketing manager for a small nonprofit here in town. Last year, we were desperately trying to find someone who could redesign our site on a low budget. Fortunately, we found someone but it was hard for me to keep up when we worked together. So, that's why I decided to take this course. I don't exactly know what would make me unique personality-wise and I don't want to give you my "interview-ready" answer so I'll just skip that one. One skill I will boast about is my organization and naming conventions. Normally I wouldn't say that to really anyone but if you had seen the system I just reorganized as a TA, you'd understand me bringing it up.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Hello, my name is Katie (she/her). I am originally from Seattle, Washington. I have lived in the Boise area for six years and have made lastly relationships. Growing up in the city was a very different lifestyle than living here in Boise. Overall, it’s just higher pace in Seattle. I am a communication major graduating this semester, so web development has never really been on my mind to learn about.  I would say my interested in web development started when I was looking for courses to enroll in this summer. I saw the potential for a great skill to have, and now I am quite excited to learning about this topic. I would say that many things make me unique, but some main ones would be my passion to make people happy/laugh, my ability to create friendships wherever I go, and I do enjoy attending music festivals. I consider myself a feminist and part of the Black Lives Matter movement. At the end of the day I wouldn’t want to put myself in specific groups because I truly care for human rights. Some skills I believe I have obtained over the years would be my ability to understand non-verbal communication, as well as making freaky fast sandwiches (I’m a manager at a Jimmy Johns).</p>

    <h3>Our Journey</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Katie and I hadn't partnered up until Week 5 after our original partners dropped the course. Both of us had zero experience in web development so this course was definitely a struggle, to say the least. However, she and I managed to get through those rough patches with a lot of hard work and dedication. We'd like to thank Youtube for allowing us to binge-watch how-to videos and get clarification on just about everything. Click below to check out our weekly interviews!</p>
