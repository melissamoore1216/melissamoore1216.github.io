        <hr>
        <p style="color:white;">I've always been a little curious about web development. As a media arts major, some of my classes have required me to create a portfolio for myself using a site like Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress,etc. I've used them all and every single one of them was great except I never actually learned anything about web development. Taking this course has introduced a new appreciation towards those who code as a living, but also for web development itself. Althogh this course was only seven weeks, I've not only learned about the basics of developing a site, but actually understood what it takes to do so. My current job requires me to manage the company's website. Something that used to take me hours to change now only takes about ten minutes. This class should be required for Media Arts majors. Otherwise, people are only limiting themselves within the PR industry.</p>
